"No matter", Axe thought, "For a one-man army is the best army of all." â€” Leaping into battle, Mogul Khan compels nearby foes to attack him with a taunting Berserker's Call. Absorbing blows from every direction, the indomitable Axe reacts by swinging his axe full circle in a Counter Helix, easily dispatching the swarm he had gathered. But alas, not all stay long enough to meet their end. The few limping away from Mogul Khan feel an inexplicable Battle Hunger, a hunger never sated before Axe slams his Culling Blade through a weakened enemy, sending them to an early grave. Axe, Axe is always charging onward.`

Using his iron gauntlet, he launches a Storm Hammer, stunning grouped enemies as he transports himself into battle, then closes in to cut them down with Great Cleave. Letting out a truly frightening Warcry, he ignites and calls upon God's Strength, a few swings of his gargantuan sword are often more than enough to slay on his hapless foes.`
