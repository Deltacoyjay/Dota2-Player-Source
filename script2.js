For the first time in his life, Rigwarl felt the need to train. His Thorny Back deters attack while peppering foes with constant baarrage of Quill Sprays. From his nose he blows Thick Gobs of Snot, slowing and covering opponents in goo. When it comes to a fight, he really puts his back into it. With every volley and every Sneeze, Rigwarl works himself into a fury, adding rage to each blow as he goes on the Warpath in search of a rematch.`

Using his iron gauntlet, he launches a Storm Hammer, stunning grouped enemies as he transports himself into battle, then closes in to cut them down with Great Cleave. Letting out a truly frightening Warcry, he ignites and calls upon God's Strength, a few swings of his gargantuan sword are often more than enough to slay on his hapless foes.`

He was no longer a dragon-slayer, but a Dragon Knight. The infusion of Dragon Blood caused his wounds to heal with inhuman speed, and granted him great new powers. While nowhere as grand as Slyrak, he found himself with the ability to Breathe Fire and launch Fireballs, immolating packs of foes at once. But when Davion took on his Elder Dragon Form, he became the formidable Eldwurm itself, and upon his awestruck enemies he rained projectiles of acid, fire, and ice."

Now brimming with Wraith Essence, Ostarion immobilizes his adversaries with Wraithfire Blast, stunning and searing them over time. His great-sword smashes foes in one Mortal Strike, sapping their essence to feed his Vampiric Spirit. Only fools trust the erratic reports of Ostarion's death. For when slain, the wraith energies that bind his body begin to reconstitute his parts, joining limb to torso until the Wraith King's Reincarnation comes full circle as his strides fearlessly towards his enemies, again."

Although normally aiming for precision, Traxex does not shy away from unorthodox methods, launching a rapid salvo of ice-tipped arrows at multiple targets at once.

Through divine will, the midday sun gives way to night, and every foe is struck by rays of lunar energy as Luna tears through their ranks with flying Moon Glaives.

Nethertoxin spreads throughout their bodies, turning wounds into fatalities, and fatigue into death. The Netherdrake's tough, Corrosive Skin protects against spell-craft, and burns assailants with acid. But it is the dreaded Viper Strike that signals the beginning of the end. The afflicted victim staggers to a crawl, barely able to take its next step. If the Netherdrake doesn't finish his targets off, the venom in their veins will."
